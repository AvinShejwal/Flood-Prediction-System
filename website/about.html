<br><br>To design a complete IoT based solution for Flood Monitoring, using
various sensors and microcontroller, on proteus software.<br> From the
microcontroller, the data will be uploaded to the Firebase, which is
the central database.<br> To design a Webapp UI, for end consumer to
display the readings in graphical format.<br>
The problem statement is divided into two parts: -<br><br>
    • Sensor data acquisition (Temperature, Humidity, Rain, Water Flow, Water Level)<br>
    • Designing the user end Webapp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript<br><br>

The flood conditions will be tracked and information are transferred
to the cloud server.<br> In this way we will be manually transmit the realtime flood information. Due to uploading in cloud server the
information can be viewed from any part of the world.<br> The system
will function with tracking and monitoring environmental
circumstances such as temperature, humidity, rain drop, water flow rate, and water level with sensors and whenever the scores
exceed a selected threshold limit for each the user will be alerted.
